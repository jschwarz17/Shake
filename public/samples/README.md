# Optional samples

**Bass:** Copy your two bass WAV files here and name them:
- **bass_primary.wav** — from `Sub_Bass_C_2026-02-16T233213.wav` (primary bass tone)
- **bass_sub.wav** — from `Sub_Bass_C_2026-02-16T232212.wav` (sub layer, toggle in module)

If these files are missing, the Bass track will load but won’t play until you add them.

**Shaker:** The app uses a free shaker sample by default. If it fails to load (e.g. CORS), add **shaker.wav** here (e.g. from [FreeWaveSamples Shaker-1](https://freewavesamples.com/shaker-1)) and the code can be switched to use `/samples/shaker.wav`.
