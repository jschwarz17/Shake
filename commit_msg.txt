Add extensive debugging for sequencer and sample playback

Sequencer debugging:
- Add red test box to verify rendering works
- Log full track objects to console
- Add inline styles to force visibility
- Add error handling for missing tracks
- Log each track as it renders

Sample playback debugging:
- Add detailed console logs for sample loading
- Log buffer duration when sample loads
- Add buffer validation before playback
- Log when samples are actually played
- Better error messages

This will help identify the root cause
